# Blockchain-based-Transparent-and-Genuine-Charity-Application

## Project Description 
Donors have every reason to fear that charitable funds will not reach people who really need them. According to the same HSE survey in 2017, 68% of citizens are willing to donate more if there is evidence of where and what they are going. By law, foundations are required to take care of public records (in particular, to publish reports on their websites), and now all reports are prepared by employees of a foundation manually .The problem of mistrust of donors and overloading of funds are often solved by organizing an external database, records during which are recorded within the blockchain. Therefore, it's important to develop a social platform supporting blockchain technology which will help non-profit organizations, foundations, volunteers and social entrepreneurs in their work and make donation processes transparent and understandable for all parties. Blockchain will allow all users of the platform to ascertain their account and an outline of every payment of the organization it supports. Also, the technology of distributed ledger will guarantee a donor that the quantity will reach the goal, and with none intermediaries consistent with Rosstat research, in 2017 there have been more than 9600 charitable foundations and about 1700 charitable organizations.

+ The organization can get donations from the platform to help other people and apply money to the cooperative shops for token exchanging. 
+ A Decentralized System That provides security and prevents loss of Transactional Data
+ The User or beneficiary can seek help and create charity projects through the platform. Donors learn about charity projects on the platform, and then donate to beneficiaries or the charity organizations. Beneficiaries upload their information to the platform for help; they can get and spend tokens accordingly.
+ Funds are transferred directly to beneficiaries .No third Party is involved.
+ Low Transaction charges as no governmental charges are included and the Transactional Fees (Gas Fees) remains same for all the transactions irrespective of the amount that is transferred.
+ A beneficiary initiates a charity project through a smart contract, and then the project will be deployed on the blockchain.

Donors view the charity project in browser and select an appropriate project to make donation. The funds will be transferred to the Dapp administrator account. When the beneficiary needs funds, the capital expenditure request is initiated with the smart contract, if most people who participate in the project agree to the request by voting, the donation funds of the project will be transferred from the Dapp administrator account to the beneficiary account.
